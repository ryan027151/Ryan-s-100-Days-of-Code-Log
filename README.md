# Ryan-s-100-Days-of-Code-Log
Hi, my name is Ryan, and in the next 100 days, I challenge myself to learn/code daily and post my daily log here to record my progress! My plan is to go through MySQL, Python OOP, DSA, and Intro to C. I will also update my progress at my Twitter ryan027151. If you are interested to learn with me, you can contact me in ryan027151@gmail.com!
