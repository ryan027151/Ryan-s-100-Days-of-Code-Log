# Ryan-s-100-Days-of-Code-Log
Hi, my name is Ryan, and in the next 100 days, I challenge myself to learn/code daily and post my daily log here to record my progress! My plan is to go through MySQL, Python OOP, DSA, and Intro to C. I will also update my progress at my Twitter ryan027151. If you are interested to learn with me, you can contact me in ryan027151@gmail.com!

Here is my three Rules I will follow throughout this challange
### Rule#1

- Learn/Code minimum 1 hours PER DAY

### Rule#2

- Tweet daily after code about my progress with hashtag #100DaysOfCode

### Rule#3

- Write daily log in Github and Twitter

*Although I shouldn't count the tutorial time, but since I'm still not an experience programmer, I might have to change the rule a little, but I will also practice coding throughout the challenge.
