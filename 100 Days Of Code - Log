###Day 1: October 7, 2022; Friday

### Today's Progress:
Today I've done a Hands-on Lab on using MySQL Built-in functions to compose and run queries, check results and view the logs, and learn how to use Sub-Queries and Nested Selects to enrich my query to the database.
### Thoughts: Although this language is not hard to learn, but it still require a good sense of logical where dealing with relational database and query.
